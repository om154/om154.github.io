Hi 👋🏻
My name is Oliver. I'm a Software Engineer 🧑🏼‍💻 based in Melbourne, Australia.

Some of my passions include sports, health & fitness🏃🏻‍♂️, coffee ☕️, restaurants & cafes, and software development. I am a curious guy, and a keen learner and I always love chatting with anyone who shares any of these interests!

If you've got something you'd like to chat about, you can contact me at [oliver@omurray.dev](mailto:oliver@omurray.dev)
